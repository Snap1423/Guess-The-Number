## 🎲 Number Guessing Game

A simple Python project where the computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it!
This is a beginner-friendly project that helps understand the use of loops, conditionals, typecasting, and random numbers in Python.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.

The player enters a guess.

If the guess is too high or too low, the computer gives a hint.

The game continues until the player guesses correctly.

The program shows how many attempts were taken.
